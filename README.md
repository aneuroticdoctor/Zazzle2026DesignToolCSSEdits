Editing the Zazzle 2026 design tool to look more like the old design tool, and to increase useability.
Current features include:
* Recoloring elements to match the old design tool - a dark blue background with white text, bright blue URL links
* Reducing screen clutter by hiding tooltips that seasoned users already know
* Reducing scale of elements to allow more tools to be visible without scrolling
* * Especially the font category selector
